# About

With a passion for both creativity and logic, I'm a programmer and web designer who excels at using digital tools to bring ideas to life. Beyond my technical skills, I'm also deeply interested in the human mind and the world of psychology , with a particular focus on mental health. As a digital artist, I hope to use my talents to raise awareness of these important topics and spark meaningful conversations about the human experience. Whether I'm designing a website, writing code, or exploring the depths of the human psyche, you can count on me to be consistently reliable and driven by my passions.
