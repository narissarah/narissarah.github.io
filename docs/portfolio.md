Dies Irae is an exciting new video game project I'm creating that combines my love for popular court cases in history with an educational twist. The game is centered around the idea that each person is getting a retrial in the afterlife, and their fate will be determined based on how good they are at defending theselves. Through engaging gameplay and immersive storytelling, I hope to educate players about court cases in history.

To bring this project to life, I used a variety of software tools, including Blender for character creation and Unity as the game engine. I also utilized Adobe Illustrator and After Effects to create the game's stunning intro, which sets the tone for the immersive and thought-provoking experience that awaits players.

At its core, Dies Irae is a celebration of the power of video games to educate, inspire, and entertain. Through engaging gameplay and immersive storytelling, I hope to spark conversations about important social and ethical issues, and to inspire players to think critically about their own lives and the choices they make. Whether viewed as a fun and engaging way to learn about history and the justice system, or as a thought-provoking exploration of the afterlife and the nature of morality, Dies Irae is a project that I am proud to have created, and one that I believe will resonate with gamers and educators alike.

My project, Goal Diggers, is a tribute to the philosophy of Ayn Rand, and reflects my deep admiration for her ideas and insights. As a writer, composer, and designer of the accompanying PDF, I have sought to capture the essence of Rand's philosophy and translate it into a visual and written medium that is accessible to a wider audience.

At the heart of Goal Diggers is the idea of individualism and the importance of pursuing one's own goals and ambitions without apology or compromise. You can achieve alot on your own.

As the creator of "Look Closer," I have poured my heart and soul into every aspect of the project, from the initial conception and planning, to the photography, editing, and composition of the final product. Every image is a reflection of my commitment to capturing the true essence of my subjects and inviting viewers to look beyond the surface to discover the hidden stories and meanings that lie beneath.

As the composer of SmokeAndMirrors, I am proud to have created every aspect of this project from scratch, using the power of Adobe Illustrations to bring my vision to life. Inspired by my own fascination with the world of optical illusions, SmokeAndMirrors is a journey into a realm where reality is not always what it seems, and where the boundaries between perception and truth are blurred.

TearsofTrafficking is a deeply personal and powerful project that explores the harsh realities of human trafficking, particularly in Thailand. Composed of two distinct works, this project is a testament to the power of art to bring attention to important social issues and raise awareness about the plight of those who are often overlooked and forgotten.

The first work in TearsofTrafficking is a thought-provoking image that juxtaposes a picture of a stranger online with my own editing. Through this work, I aim to highlight the disconnection and detachment that often exists between those who suffer from human trafficking and the rest of the world. By manipulating the image, I hope to convey the sense of isolation and loneliness that so many victims of trafficking experience on a daily basis.

The second work in TearsofTrafficking features me. I then editing the pictures to place myself in a suitcase. This powerful image is a stark reminder of the common occurrence of trafficking in Thailand, and the devastating impact that it can have on the lives of those who are affected. Through this work, I aim to raise awareness about the issue of trafficking and inspire others to take action to address this important social problem.

Furious Fox is a project that celebrates my deep admiration for Japanese culture and its rich history. As a lover of Japanese art and design, I wanted to create a vector logo that captured the power and majesty of the country's legendary fox spirits, without resorting to the often-cutesy and cartoonish portrayals that are so common in popular culture.
