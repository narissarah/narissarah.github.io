class="header-anchor" href="#shoe-poem" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>As you can see, I have a deep passion for writing, which has led me to create a vast collection of written content. I know that showcasing this much written material may not be the most visually appealing design choice (especially for an art school), but I believe that the best way to display my talent as a writer is by presenting my work in its most authentic form. Whether it&#39;s through my art projects or my personal writing, literature has always played a vital role in my life. As an extension of this, I also enjoy writing poetry, and I&#39;ve decided to share this aspect of my writing through video and audio recordings. To make this project even more special, my dear friend Miranda has graciously agreed to contribute to it. So, come along with us as we embark on this collaborative journey and experience the beauty of words through our eyes and ears. Please dont penalty me for this. I understand you are busy and have many applicants to go through. Feel free to gloss over the words and just look at my works if you are exhausted from reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/vPwA-SJDlZ0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Youtube</a></p><h2 id="galavant-title-sequence" tabindex="-1">Galavant Title Sequence <a class="header-anchor" href="#galavant-title-sequence" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Welcome to my video editing project featuring my favorite TV show! As a dedicated fan of this show, I have always been moved by its compelling storyline, well-crafted characters, and breathtaking visuals. However, there was one particular aspect of the show that never failed to stir up my emotions - its title sequence. Every time I watched it, I couldn&#39;t help but feel overwhelmed by how ...bad it is. So, I took on the challenge of creating my own title sequence for the show. In this project, I aimed to capture the essence of the show and showcase my passion for video editing. Join me on this journey as I unveil my interpretation of the title sequence and celebrate my love for this incredible TV show.
